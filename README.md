# Mastering-Python-Data-Analysis
Chapter-wise code examples

This is the code repository for [Mastering Python Data Analysis](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/mastering-python-data-analysis?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781783553297), published by Packt Publishing. It contains all the supporting code files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

All you need to follow through the examples in this book is a computer running any recent version of Python. While the examples use Python 3, they can easily be adapted to work with Python 2, with only minor changes. The packages used in the examples are NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Pandas, statsmodels, PyMC, Scikit-learn. Optionally, the packages basemap and cartopy are used to plot coordinate points on maps. The easiest way to obtain and maintain a Python environment that meets all the requirements of this book is to download a prepackaged Python distribution. In this book, we have checked all the code against Continuum Analytics' Anaconda Python distribution and Ubuntu Xenial Xerus (16.04) running Python 3.

This book is intended for professionals with a beginner to intermediate level of Python programming knowledge who want to move in the direction of solving more sophisticated problems and gain deeper insights through advanced data analysis. Some experience with the math behind basic statistics is assumed, but quick introductions are given where required. If you want to learn the breadth of statistical analysis techniques in Python and get an overview of the methods and tools available, you will find this book helpful. Each chapter consists of a number of examples using mostly real-world data to highlight various aspects of the topic and teach how to conduct data analysis from start to finish.
